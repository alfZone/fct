## classes Users and Authentication

The two class Users and Authentication should be copy to your web site. The namespace and use path should also be redefine acording to your foldes.

`namespace classes\db;`

`use classes\db\LayerDB;`

The User and Authentication classes may already exist in your project. Be careful if you decide to change them. Make a backup of that first.

**a.** The Users class must have a mysql statement to display a list of valid users for the site

"loginGoogle" => 'SELECT `id`, `email`, `name`, `type`  FROM `authUser` WHERE `email`=:email and active=1'

If name isn't the name of the field for the user's name, mask it as name for better compatibility.

for exemple:

"loginGoogle" => 'SELECT id, nameOfUser as name FROM tableUsers WHERE block=0 order by nameOfUser '

**b.** The Authentication class can be modified if you want to change the number of session variables.
